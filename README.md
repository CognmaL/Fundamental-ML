## üì¶ Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **/data**: This directory contains the facial expression dataset. You'll need to download the dataset and place it here before running the notebooks. (Download link provided below)
- **/notebooks**: This directory contains the Jupyter notebook ``EDA.ipynb``. This notebook guides you through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification tasks.
- **/models:** This directory folder stores pretrain models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
